# CMIP7 Participation for Data Managers

!!! tip "Documentation in progress"

    The contents of the pages are currently in development.
    They will updated when ESGF-NG (Next Generation ESGF) is available for CMIP7 data publication.
    [See here](https://wcrp-cmip.org/esgf-information/) for previous announcements about ESGF changes.


## 1. Installation and configuration
All information on Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) can be [found here](https://esgf.github.io/).
<!-- _this needs updating?_ -->
<!-- _Somewhere in the documentation below needs a) information about QC procedures for Data Managers and b) graphic of the ESGF NG setup (Forrest/Phil have sent examples to IPO)_ -->

### 1.1 ESGF Software
**Description**

The ESGF Data Node software stack enables sites hosting earth system data to make it available to the community over several transfer protocols including http(s).  Data node sites run esg-publisher software to register their hosted data to the ESGF index managed by the ESGF core team.  Sites may additonally run optional esgf-compute software (WPS) to support server-side computation over the hosted data.
<!-- ~~Index nodes enable search for hosted data via data publishing to the index, and these nodes include a search API and web frontend~~._not sure this is relevant if indexing is deprecated_?  -->
<!-- Identity nodes manage user accounts. Nodes run as Docker containers and can be deployed via Ansible Playbooks or Helm Charts in a Kubernetes environment. -->

**New and exisiting installations**

For new or exisiting ESGF node installations, ESGF policies will influence the type of installation you need to deploy.
Updated information on ESGF policies will be added here soon.
<!-- For new or exisiting ESGF node installations, first read the [following document](www.esgf.com) on ESGF policies, as this will influence the type of installation you need to deploy.  -->
<!-- _needs proper link and updating_  -->

### 1.2 How to install data node services
**Requirements, setup and usage documentation**

**Software Stack**
The ESGF software stack requires Linux RedHat Enterprise or Rocky/Alma distributions. Administrators must have full sudo privileges to root access or a Kubernetes Cluster.
The services are meant to run on webserver-grade hardware.
For data-sharing nodes the storage holding your data must be mounted on the node. 
<!-- _need a practical example here with cost estimate_.  -->
<!-- The services are meant to run on [webserver-grade hardware](www.exaple.com).  ADD VALID LINK -->

**ESGF Docker** 
Instructions and links to any issuses can be [found here](https://github.com/ESGF/esgf-docker/).


**Metagrid user interface - optional**
To install the Metagrid UI for end-users to search and download data, read the documentation [here](https://metagrid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and see the Github repo [here](https://github.com/esgf2-us/metagrid). 

### 1.3 Compute Node services

_Coming soon...._


## 2. Dataset publication 


### 2.1 Requirements

Publishers to ESGF **must** have an existing Data Node installed at their site. Although the publisher software (from v5.x onwards) does not need to run on the Data Node it does require a _Data mount_ for the software to access data files. 

### 2.2 Introduction to ESGF-NG and Authorization for Publishing

Please read the following [ESGF-NG Onboarding](https://github.com/ESGF/esgf-ng-onboarding/tree/main) pages hosted at GitHub.  These introduce the STAC Transaction API endpoint options and the two ESGF authentication domains: Globus and EGI Auth.  Each domain/system has separare policies for account and authorization management.  You cannot publish until you have established an authorized account to publish.

### 2.3 Dataset preparation 
The ESGF publication process requires robust and effective data management, which can also be a burden for data managers. However, the [ESGF esgprep toolbox](https://esgf.github.io/esgf-prepare/) is a piece of software that enables data preparation according to ESGF best practices. Esgprep allows the data providers and data node managers to easily prepare their data for publishing to an ESGF node - it is a standalone toolbox. It can be used to fetch required configuration files, apply the Data Reference Syntax on local filesystems and/or generate mapfiles for ESGF publication.

Full details of _esgprep_ and instructions for use provided by the team at Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace (IPSL) can be [found here](https://esgf.github.io/esgf-prepare/).  Note that the package requires an `esgvoc` installation
- `esgvoc use cmip7@latest` will fetch your CVs needed for esgprep and `compliance-checker` with the WCRP plugin.


### 2.4 Publisher introduction 
The esg-publisher or _esgcet_ Python package contains a collection of command-line utilities to scan, manipulate and push dataset metadata to an ESGF index node. 
The basic publication process takes several steps with some optional steps. Publisher functionality is available via several submodles/classes in the package.
Please refer to the [user documentation](https://esg-publisher.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html) and [Github issues page](https://github.com/ESGF/esg-publisher/issues)

The publisher installation includes the IOOS checker and WCRP plugins. 

### 2.5 ESG-Publisher software installation 
**Requirements** 

1. A python environment, using venv, conda, miniforge/mamba etc. 
2. Mountpoint map to data on the same host as the publisher software installation, so the publisher has access to scan data using the integrated XArray package.
3. Basic dataset information provided via the esg mapfile format. For example using the esgf-prepare/esgmapfile utility.
4.  `pip install esgcet` will install the most recent version of the package.

### 2.6. Authorizarion to Publish  

- In order to publish, `esgpublish` will need to establish your publishing credential when run for the first time.
- Alternatively run `esglogin [--config </path/to/your/esg.yaml>]` as that can be run without invoking `esgpublish`
- You will be prompted to fetch a token by *copy/pasting* a link to your browser.  Follow instructions with the authorization code.  This process will establish your access token to publish.

### 2.7 Dataset publication
Full details of the dataset publication process using _pip install_ to install _esgcet_ can be found [here](https://esg-publisher.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html)

In the examples below, the configuration file is installed in a default location of `$HOME/.esg.yaml`.  the `<DRS-dataset-id>` follows the CMIP7 DRS structure and uses dot `.` delimters between each controlled-vocabulary property ending with the *Directory Date* as in the form `v20YYMMDD`.

**Example command:**
```
esgpublish --map <DRS-dataset-id>.map
```
Where a `.map` file has been generated by the `esgmapfile` command from the `esgf-prepare` toolbox.

*Please note* that publication will automatically run the per-file QAQC process as stipulated in the CMIP7 toml, and this process is a requirement for publication to the CMIP7 collection in the ESGF catalog.  Data that fails a QC check yet was published by means of tampering with the publisher will be subject to removal from the catalog at a later date.

 - When you run `esgpublish`, and provided that your data scans for extraction without error, and you skip the _esglogin_ step, you will be prompted to fetch a token by *copy/pasting* a link to your browser.  Follow instructions with the authorization code.  This process will establish your access token to publish.

## 3. Dataset retraction

### 3.1 Retraction process
The _esgunpublish_ command retracts, or, upon specification, deletes a specified dataset(s). The output of this command is either a success or failure message accompanied with the id of the dataset that was retracted. **Exercise caution** when deleting datasets. If replicas have been made or if you will be republishing, **you should retract** rather than delete outright. Follow the instructions [here](https://esg-publisher.readthedocs.io/en/stable/esgunpublish.html) and for an example, check out the [Jupyter notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/ESGF/esg-publisher/blob/main/notebooks/unpublish-list.ipynb)

**Example command:**
```
esgunpublish --dset-id <DRS-dataset-id>
```

## 4. Versioning and Errata

### 4.1 Versioning datasets

Anytime there is any change to a published dataset, an new dataset version must be created. 
The version identifier is the last component of a CMIP7 dataset's directory path.
Sites **must ensure** that an updated dataset is never erroneously published using the same version identifier as its previous version.

CMOR by default will write the version identifier in the output directory path as the current date (example: `v20260511`).
However the version can also be user-specified as an input to CMOR.
Sites that use CMOR should ensure that version identifiers are correctly specified for updated datasets (i.e., that a previous user-specified version is not mistakenly applied to updated version of a dataset).

Alternatively, and in cases where CMOR is not used, the [ESGDRS Tool](https://esgf.github.io/esgf-prepare/drs.html) can be used to set the version identifier.

Once a new version is added follow the same publication procedures to publish the updated data.  The new dataset will supersede the prior version in ESGF data discovery.

### 4.2 Errata Service

When a site creates an updated version of a dataset, or retracts a dataset, an Errata must be opened using the [Errata service](https://errata.esgf.io/).  Please see the [Errata documentation](https://ipsl.gitbook.io/esgf-errata-service) on the procedures.  Users can also create Errata, and it is the responsibility of the data managers or modelers to review user-created Errata issues to confirm or challenge the input.
